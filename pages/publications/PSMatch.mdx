# [PSMatch: an R/Bioconductor package to explore proteomics identification data.](https://osf.io/preprints/osf/62v9p_v1)

We present the R/Bioconductor PSMatch package, that helps proteomics practitioners to load,
manage and handle peptide spectrum matches. It provides functions to model peptide-protein 
relations, visualise these as graphs and make informed decisions about shared peptide filtering. 
The package also provides functions to calculate fragments and, in conjunction with the Spectra 
package, annotate and visualise MS2 scans.

## Installation

Open an R environment and run the following code chunk:

```r
if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")

BiocManager::install("PSMatch")
library(PSMatch)
```
