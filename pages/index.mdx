# Who am I ?

Hi there. 

I am Guillaume Deflandre, a PhD student at the [UCLouvain](https://www.uclouvain.be/en), 
based at the [de Duve institute](https://www.deduveinstitute.be/) in Brussels. 
I am part of [Laurent Gatto](https://lgatto.github.io/)'s CBIO lab and my focus lies on 
optimisation of peptidoform identifications in single-cell proteomics. To do so, I apply 
my bioinformatic knowledge daily into a variety of projects.

If you want to learn more about those projects or are interested in some form of collaboration, 
you can contact me by mail: guillaume.deflandre@uclouvain.be
